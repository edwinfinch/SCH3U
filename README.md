Repository for chemistry.edwinfinch.com! Messy and terrible code but it works.

Built for Mr. Greisman's grade 11 chemistry class! Based off of <a href="http://sch3u-ccvi.wikispaces.com/SCH3U1+Multiple+Choice+Program">
this original Java application.

I built this because Java isn't found on mobile devices, and everyone should be able to access it, so I figured why
not port it to the web?

If you'd like to contribute, make a pull request and I'll merge your changes to the website within the time it takes me
to review your code and test it.
